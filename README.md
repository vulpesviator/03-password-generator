# Javascript Random Password Generator 

## Description

This project utilizes JavaScript in order to create a unique and randomized password based on the user's input on length of password and specific character sets to use in generating the password. The password generator requires at least one set of characters to use in order to create the password (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or OWASP Foundation recommended special characters) and that the password be between 8 and 128 characters in length.   

## Usage

The site is currently deployed for review on [github pages](#).
